# Challenge-1


## Description 

The webpage for Horiseon is focused on displaying their focuses which is presented in a way that it is engaging with the reader. I was given the code for this webpage in which I was tasked with making it more accessible for others that may work on this project in the future. 

Making the code more accessible came in many ways, this included the following. I started by adding alt text to all of the images, so it is easily displayed what the images show, regardless of whether you can actually see them or not.

 Then I moved onto adding semantic elements. Dividing the webpage into clear sections so that it is clear for anyone to see what code is relevant to which section of the webpage.

 Lastly, I condensed the CSS file so that any repeating code was put together. This makes it easier to read and reduces the length of the file, avoiding any confusion or problems trying to find things.
